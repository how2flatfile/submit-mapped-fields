# Getting Started

## For visual learners

If you want to just follow the video on how to get everything done, [here is a Loom video](https://www.loom.com/share/3c84b02d2dc1417eb390990da2284341?sid=ffe81805-94ca-4e98-84f8-9529624650be) for you.

**IMPORTANT -** If you follow the video above to get everything set up, the information below ***is still valuable to you***. 

I recommend you read through it.


## Step-by-step instructions

*The instructions below are intentionally very detailed and descriptive to help any developer, regardless of their skill level.*

### Basics
[Click this link](https://github.com/how2flatfile/submit-mapped-fields) to access the repository.
Make sure that you are looking at the branch called `main`.
Click on the green button that says `<> Code`, and copy the URL.
Open your IDE (VS Code in my case, per the video above), and clone the repository using the URL you just copied.
Save the project on your computer (I prefer to save on the Desktop while I test).

### Code Setup (valuable information for anyone)
